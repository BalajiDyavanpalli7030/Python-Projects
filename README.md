# Sarathi Sunday English Speakers' Club

Here I Developed SSESC Management System by using Python Tkinter.
It is a very useful Softwere to store and retrieve every members data.

Sarathi Sunday English Speakers' Club is the only Sunday English Speakers' club in India.
It was established in 2005. Prof.Vitthal Vanga sir is the founder of this club.
It improves the student's employbility skills.

Every Sunday SSESC conducts a nice program for all the Sarthians(members).
In that program we have different rounds which are so helpful to improve softskill's.

Executive Body leads the Every program.
In EXECUTIVE BODY SSESC have every member with different post like President,vice president,
Secretary ,joint secretary and body members.
So I have kept one block to Store and retrieve every body members data i.e Executive Body

Every sunday SSESC have a different theme and different anchors.
So I have added one function to edit theme and anchors.

In this Softwere Todays Members refers to how many members came for that Sunday.
