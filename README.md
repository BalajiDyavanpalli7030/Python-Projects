# Sarathi Sunday English Speakers' Club

## overview

Here I Developed SSESC Management System by using Python Tkinter.
It is a very useful Softwere to store and retrieve every members data.

Sarathi Sunday English Speakers' Club is the only Sunday English Speakers' club in India.
It was established in 2005. Prof.Vitthal Vanga sir is the founder of this club.
It improves the student's employbility skills.


## Motivation

Since 15 years SSESC is storing the members data into files. Now you all know todays Digital World.
So I decided to make one softwere which will be helpful for my SSESC club.
I collected all the requirements of this club from Prof.Vitthal Vanga & Rahul Vanga and I made it.
I got this inspiration from my friend Nilesh Chilka to make this softwere efficiently.


## Demo


## Installation

The Code is written in Python 3.7. If you don't have Python installed you can find it here. If you are using a lower version of Python you can upgrade using the pip package, ensuring you have the latest version of pip. To install the required packages and libraries, run this command in the project directory after cloning the repository:


1.Download the repository

``` markdown
      $ git clone https://github.com/BalajiDyavanpalli7030/SSESC-Management-System
```

2.Locate repository

``` markdown 
      $ cd SSESC-Management-System
```

3.Install requirements.txt
``` markdown
      pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Every Sunday SSESC conducts a nice program for all the Sarthians(members).
In that program we have different rounds which are so helpful to improve softskill's.

Executive Body leads the Every program.
In EXECUTIVE BODY SSESC have every member with different post like President,vice president,
Secretary ,joint secretary and body members.
So I have kept one block to Store and retrieve every body members data i.e Executive Body

Every sunday SSESC have a different theme and different anchors.
So I have added one function to edit theme and anchors.

In this Softwere Todays Members refers to how many members came for that Sunday.
